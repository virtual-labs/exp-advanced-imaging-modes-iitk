Preparation of sample:
<br>
•	Begin by preparing the sample, ensuring it is clean, dry, and has a conductive surface to prevent charging during SEM imaging. For non-conductive samples, apply a thin conductive coating (e.g., gold or carbon). Additionally, polish the sample to a mirror-like finish, especially if electron channelling or EBSD analysis is planned, to minimize surface roughness and ensure accurate results.
<br>
SEM Initial Setup:
<br>
•	Load the prepared sample into the SEM chamber and set the appropriate accelerating voltage (commonly between 10-30 kV, depending on the analysis required). Calibrate the SEM for optimal focus and beam alignment. Select the desired imaging mode (BSE, SE, TLD, etc.) based on the specific analysis objectives.
<br>
Backscattered Electron Imaging (BSE) imaging:
<br>
•	If compositional contrast is needed, switch to the BSE mode. Adjust the SEM settings to maximize the detection of backscattered electrons, which are proportional to the atomic number of the elements. Capture BSE images to identify phase distributions, and compositional variations, or detect inclusions within the sample. Heavier elements will appear brighter, while lighter elements will appear darker in the images.
<br>
Through-Lens Detection (TLD):
<br>
•	Activate the TLD mode for high-resolution imaging that simultaneously captures secondary electrons (SE), backscattered electrons (BSE), and transmitted electrons. The TLD system enhances detection efficiency, reduces noise, and provides detailed surface topography and depth information. Use this mode to obtain high-quality images with comprehensive surface detail.
<br>
Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS):
<br>
•	Insert the EDS detector into the SEM chamber for compositional analysis. Adjust the SEM’s beam energy to optimize X-ray generation (typically 15-20 kV). Perform elemental mapping by focusing the electron beam on the sample and collecting X-ray signals. Generate maps that reveal the distribution of elements across the sample surface, which can be combined with BSE or TLD images for comprehensive analysis.
